OCF Decal Intro to Networks
Subtitle
hello everybody welcome to ocf decal um today's lecture is going to be about
the introduction to networks i'm tony liam
so um let's get started … so what we are
going to talk about today is um first some brief overview of
computer networks and then i will introduce some system
admin commands and i will do a demo live during the lab
and well um so the introduction to networks
so networks are built for communication right it seems to be easy but it's
actually really complicated well there are some desirable properties
that a computer network needs to satisfy for example low latency well you want
the time to reach another computer to be low you want high
throughput that is you want to be able to transfer
a large amount of data really quickly you want it you want the network to be
fault tolerant um when the subset of a network is down
then the network should continue to be functional
and there are even more desirable properties to come
we'll have a peek into the basic concepts in this lecture
um the first concept is the mac address well mac stands for media access control
it is an address that is uniquely assigned to each physical
device for example your networking card so it's also referred to
as uh the physical address um it's six bytes well
six uh so here we write byte in hexadecimal so it's also called
outlets of the first three oclets refer to the organization
which creates this physical device for example
in this example mac address the purple part is the oui
which identifies the factory uh the manufacturer to be gigabyte
and then the green part identifies the card
uh the networking card that you use however a limitation of mac addresses
that they can only only be used to
communicate within the same local network
if you need global communication we need something else
that is ip address
um every computer has its own ip address except some special circumstances
there are basically two types of ipaddress that
that are commonly used the first type is called
ipv4 … it has 32 bits so 32 bits basically means four bytes
so uh it is usually divided into four segments
it's formatted it's formatted like uh the example address
one two three point four five point uh six seven point eight nine
well because the ipv4 address has only 32 bits
there are only a limited amount of ipv4 addresses
even fewer than the number of population in the world how do we solve the problem
well um even uh even if we use up all the ip
addresses we cannot we cannot assign everybody a unique ip
there are two solutions the first solution is the net
network address translation which allows several computers to use the same public
ip address how do we do that well if
i use my iphone and my mac in a same wi-fi it's really likely that my
iphone and my mac will share the same ip
address i mean the same public type address but
they will have different private ip iphones
this solves the problem since um ipgs's local ip addresses can be shared between
devices then we can have more than three uh 4.3
billion devices with only ipv4 address
another solution is to use ipv6 well ipv6 is basically you can think of
it as an extension of ipv4
um it has 128 bits so it's much wider than ipv4
and we we can assign ipv6 addresses to uh not only every
every people every person … but we can assign
uh those exercises even to each particle of sand
in the world so that's basically a lot of ip addresses that is not going
to be used up in some like a couple of years
or a couple of decades or a couple of centuries probably … um okay so
this is the ipitrust … um however we want to group ip address so that we
can manage them easily for example lcf has a lot of computers
right each of them has an ip address if we
just assign ip addresses randomly then it's really easy to just mess them
up then the concept of subnet is really useful
so we we use the cdl format to manage a subnet or a range of ip address
so cdr stands for careless inter-domain routing
and it's basically a ip address with a slash
and a number so this this number is called mask
so um in this example in this cdr example
uh let's point to it pointer in this cdr example uh the mask is 24.
so um after transforming this
ip address into the binary format as shown here
we take the first 24 bits and label it as a green color
and the eight bits here will give it a red color
um for the part of five pages in the green color part
they should be the same if uh the computers are in the sub same sub
network uh the eight bits well they can differ
so um with this cdr if we have a ip address of one
192.168.1.100 after transforming it into a binary form
like this one we need to compare the first 24 bits
well as you can see they are the same so this type address is in the same subnet
as this cedar um let's
uh go through any an example um suppose that we have a subnet of
12.4.0.1 15. … and we want to
um see whether whether uh this ip address let's see the
network the 12.5.4.1 stuff
we will need to first convert this ip address
into a binary form so this uh this row is the binary form of the
above ipo address and then we need to take the mask
by uh labeling the first 15 bits to be one
so these 15 bits are within our consideration
but those bits after the 15 bits are not we can just discard
those bits and set them as zero
um so um it's told that 5.4. the one in the same network let's see so um the
difference between this type of address and this ipad
address is basically
the second byte and the third bite but because the third byte is not
what we want to consider which is this garden
so then we have the second bite so this is a a5 converted into binary
it's uh 101 so here the 100 should be changed to
one 101 well because uh this bit
the last one 101 or one or zero this is zero or what is not what we are
considering about we will just discard this bit and then
we need to compare because the 100 and 101
share these uh two bits the one and zero
the uh this ip address has the same 15 bits as
this ip address so it's basically um … in the sub same subnet
so yes … so well what about this one what about this side futurist
is it in the same sub-network
well actually not because um when we convert
6 into binary form it's 1-1-0 and we will copy the 1-1-0 to here the
the last 0 needs to be discarded and the 1 1 corresponds to these two bytes
however uh this the green part the the subnet ip address that we need
to compare well it has a 1 0 here instead of a 1 1
so that doesn't work so this type of address is in the
different network uh than what this cdr specifies
if you think this is too fast feel free to ask questions
during live lab sessions
so no this is not in the same network okay so um this part is
fairly complicated i mean the routing part um
if i go too fast in this part feel free to pause the video for a minute to think
about how routing works so let's get started
so um after we have an ip address for example i want to visit my server
and i have the service ip address how do we get from the ocf server
to my server … how do we how do we get to the how do we get to my
server from the ocf server … we need to jump between
networks using a table called routing table
so the routing table specifies a subnet and how the subnet
is going to be reached … so let's go through
an example which will illustrate this concept
um so supposedly we're on medcal and this is the the math house ip
address and we want to go to my server so this ip address
so let's see so my service ip starts with
157. … so well it's 157 in this cdr that's not because it starts with
169 and the cdr has 24 bits so
it's not so it's not in our local network
then it's um it should be this one because this c dart has a slash zero
which means for every iphs we will assign it to um
to this form except uh the rule that has higher priority for example
this one because 157 doesn't match this rule we
will go through this rule and you will be sent to uh 169
to 29 to 226.1 … so basically this uh in this cedar subnet
and uh in the ocf router like this ip in the ocf router we will
go through uh another for another lookup in
another routing table well because my my server starts with 157 it doesn't
match any of these so it will go to this rule
and then it will be sent to another router so
this process will just go on until we reach my server
or we fail to reach my server and you will get a timeout
so that's basically how routing works again if you think i go too fast in this
part feel free to pause the video for a minute to
think about it … or ask questions in uh live sessions
so yeah um so right now we are able to connect to
a computer far away that's really great however
the network is probably not so reliable and
a packet may be lost when it's when it is transported from
one computer to another well that's not a good idea because
suppose that you're loading a website and well probably um
when the host sorry when the server is sending you
the text a part of the text can be lost or corrupted
that's not where we want to see how do we solve the problem … we will use
something called tcp transmission control protocol
well tcp uh gets us more reliability although with
potentially more latency and complexity … so it's not always useful
but useful for some circumstances such as visiting websites
you absolutely don't want to see um corrupted text
when you when you visit a website right so that's why
websites which uses http or https protocols
they would use transmission control protocol tcp
under the hood however sometimes well time is just more
important than reliability well for example while you attend
a live lecture using zoom [Music]
the packet loss may not be a really serious
consideration because even if the packet is corrupted
or even lost you can still view the video it's well it's just a
little bit noisy or … a little bit blurry or something like
that but it was continued to work however if you have a
really long latency like for example for example five
seconds it would be a really worst case right so um for these use
cases you probably don't want to use tcp
instead you could try udp will not cover udp
uh in this lecture but you can look it up
um another protocol is icmp which which is uses which is used by
ping we'll introduce the pin command later in
this lecture
well yes we're we're now able to transmit
complete information from a server to another server
reliably but wait what if i want to visit
wikipedia.org … i i just don't know wikipedia's ip address
how do we do that how do i look up the service ip address because
it's really complicated to memorize i just don't want to memorize it
then we would use dns which is domain name system
well dns has you can think of it as a notebook it has
several records so while you visit wikipedia.org
you're basically looking up this table for uh the record for ip address
so uh take wikipedia as an example if you're looking for the ip address of
this website … the dns server will tell you
the final ip address and then you've got the ip address you can use tcp to visit
it and what's more is that uh you not only
have to use ipv4 … and ipv6
you can even point the domain to another domain
by adding another kind of record so the record for assigning
assigning a domain to an ipv4 address is called the a record and
if you want to assign a domain to a ipv6 address you will use aaa record
if you want to point for example wikipedia.org to www.wikipedia.org
because it's probably easier to manage you'll probably use
cname record … and another important type of record is the mx record
you could … designate like specify the mail servers uh
that this domain uses for example if you are a leader of a group at uc
berkeley and you want to enable your own uh email
under a berkeley sub domain for example ocf.berkeley.edu
you need to request to add an mx record to
enable this kind of service there are even
other types of records you can look them up
online it's really fun to read okay it's um it's the system admin time
after um all those concepts let's see um so we have
uh several tools that i'm gonna introduce today however
i'm gonna do the demo live um during the the laptime so that you'll be
able to ask questions … um let's see
um the first command is uh is the hostname command
well if you type hostname you can display the
the current host basically the hostname name
the host is just computer you can think of
a hostname the name of your own computer if you type hostname it will return
the simplified hostname by default however if you want to carry
the full qualified domain name fqtn you will use
fqdn as a flag and you will return the full domain name here
and then host well hostname is for getting your own hostname
what if you want to get information about other hosts
you would type host and then another domain name or ip address
and then ping well ping is a really easy way to
make sure that you'll be able to access another
computer or host or server from your computer
so when you type ping and put in domain name or ip address you will see
whether the server is accessible from
your own computer well in this case um ocf can be visited from this server
in four milliseconds which is pretty fast
and trace route um you could use tracer to
print the route the packet takes in order to reach the destination
um so this shows the the path uh from a server to
google.com
and yeah it's a it's a lot of berkeley routers and then some other
routers here i recommend you to try this one on your
own because it will be really interesting to see
how many routers you will need to use before accessing a website
and then the arp command um you can do you can use arp command to
uh get the mac address associated with an ip address
and traceroute um
sorry and the date command um dig is the utility to look up
a dns uh basically if you wanna look up an ip from a domain name
just like uh the example that i gave you with
uh wikipedia you would type dick wikipedia.org
and then in the answer section you will see you will see
so here we have an a so a basically means the ipv4
and then we get ipv4 address um from this command
and the last command the double get our crl
this is basically two commands so you can use this command to download content
from um web or just display contents so here i use clio to display the
content of our lab as you can see it's in the
markdown format and here is um the lab
i add a head here to get the first 10 lines of the lab
so yeah so that's it and that's basically everything that i want to
cover today and thanks for attending this web
lecture have a great day
